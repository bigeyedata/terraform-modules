# Terraform Modules

This repository holds terraform modules used to install
the Bigeye stack into an AWS Environment.

## Prerequisites

### Terraform

[Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli#install-terraform)
- at least version 1.0.
We find that `tfenv` ([link](https://github.com/tfutils/tfenv)) is a useful way
to install & manage Terraform versions. 

### AWS

You need the [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)
installed and configured with credentials for your AWS account.

## Getting Started

Check out one of [examples](./examples/) to get started with your Bigeye stack!
